                After working on Mineshaft Mayhem, I was frustrated with the locked pipelines of most main stream game engines. 
                I wanted to try doing things differently, so I gathered some students who had been working on similar projects, and pitched my idea.
                The project was titled Hatchit, and began development in early 2016.
                Hatchit is an open source engine that gives developers as much control over the pipeline as possible.
			</p><p class=text>
				Not long after we began planning the project, Vulkan was released. 
                If we could get this thing to work, it would be amazing. 
			</p><p class=text>
                Unsurprisingly, it was hard. There was basically no information available, and the Vulkan documentation was... difficult to read.
                At first, we wanted to support both Vulkan and DirectX12, but later on, we ditched DirectX in favor of having one thing that worked.
                We ran into problems with our content managment system. 
                I struggled with SSE while trying to write a math library. 
                We ran into some really frustrating bugs when we tried to multithread certain parts of the graphics process.
			</p><p class=text>
                After 15 weeks of smashing our faces into our keyboards, we had a couple of models and some lights. 
                I don't think I've ever been so happy to see shapes and colors on a screen.

			<p class=text>
                Mineshaft Mayhem is an endless runner game I developed with a team in Fall 2015. 
                The player must avoid collisions with rocks and other obstacles, and 
                gains score based on distance traveled, and by collecting gems distributed along the track. 
			</p><p class=text>
				The gameplay is relatively simple, but the main focus of our project was the graphics. 
                In order to quickly prototype the game and get it to work, we used a lua binding library, and wrote all of our game logic in scripts.
                I probably wouldn't do it that way again. It was cool, but it was also really slow.
                The project was developed from scratch in C++ in a custom engine with DirectX11. 
			</p><p class=text>
                Most prominently among the games graphical effects is the bending track. 
                Although it appears to curve, the track is actually entirely straight. 
                I developed a system that used the vertex shader to dynamically transform the positions of vertices being rendered. 
                At first, the effect was as simple as applying a downward curve to the track, but I wasn't happy with how it looked.
                I started playing with trig curves to try to get a hills, which looked awesome, but watching it was making people nauseous. 
                I later realized that this could be improved by rotating everything ever so slightly so that the camera was facing the same direction as the cart. 
			</p><p class=text>
                Then came another problem: Lighting. 
                Normal lighting calculations weren't going to work, because the geometry and lights weren't in the same coordinate space. 
                The only way to fix it was to use a deferred shading pipeline.
                Nobody on the project had every done any serious graphics programming before, so this was a serious challenge.
                It took up the majority of my time on the project, but it was worth it.

                Soul Bound is a turn based tactical strategy game that grew out of a student project in the spring semester of 2015. 
                The player explores a fantasy world, where magic is a powerful force of nature capable of granting, and taking life. 
                Our protagonists make unlikely friends, and encounter bizarre and fantastic creatures on their journey.

				Our first demo left much to be desired in terms of maintainability.
                This was my first experience leading a group of programmers, and it was a challenge. 
                I can manage myself fine, but communicating effectively with a team is something I'll always have to work on. 
			</p><p class=text>
                When I wasn't writing code, I was working on the combat system design in my notebook. 
                After several iterations, we found something that seemed to work well. 
                Our demo contained numerous game-breaking bugs, and art without consistent style, 
                but the ai worked, and the combat was solid. We had a playable game. 
			</p><p class=text>
                The following summer I continued work on the project with a smaller group. 
                After the nightmare of bugs in the old version, I had to scrap almost all of the code. 
                I took all of the mistakes that I'd made before, and used them to make something better. 
                Not only was it more stable, but it added room for new features. 
                I was able to add terrain elevation, fog of war, game saves, and a modular script based spell system. 
                Our artists were able to produce higher quality assets too. 
                The end result was a pretty good looking game.

                Atlas is a resource for students looking to learn the coding skills required for professional game development.
                I worked on Atlas in the fall of 2016 at RIT through a grant from the Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences (GCCIS).
                Atlas uses Github to host hundreds of different code examples/tutorials,
                and a website that organizes the information, and helps students track their progress through a branching skill tree of tutorials.
			</p><p class=text>
                Game development is an immense field, one that hasn't existed for very long, and game development education has only existed for a few years.
                As technology evolves, professors are forced to rewrite curriculum over and over, and try to teach students the most useful information they can.
                This problem is most pronounced when our students try to apply more advanced concepts in a language they may not be familiar with: C++.
                Atlas provides a platform where students can gain a greater understanding of the tools that they have,
                and can better use them to solve real world programming problems.
			</p><p class=text>
                My primary responsibility on the project was as a developer and curator of a core set of C++ and OpenGL tutorials.
                My C++ work covered everything from Hello World to Templates and Lambda Expressions.
                The OpenGL examples provide a path from drawing a triangle with a fixed shader pipeline,
                to the use of more advanced concepts like deferred shading, particle simulations, etc.
                I also developed the front end for the website to present the examples we had in a readable way.

		<!--Description-->
		<div class=doubletile>
			<p class=text>
				Cheating Death is a tabletop board game that addresses the unpredictability of life and the inevitability of death.
                Players use everything in their power to impede their own progress towards death as they accrue afflictions, and encounter life altering events.
			</p><p class=text>
                The game carries the appearance, and base mechanics of a simple roll and move style board game.
                This may be initially off-putting to veteran gamers, as the genre has a negative reputation for lacking player engagement and agency.
                Players who set aside their initial skepticism to play are often surprised to find that
                Cheating Death offers engaging theme, meaningful decisions, and excellent pacing.
			</p><p class=text>
				Development began in the spring of 2014 after I pitched the idea as a student project.
                At first, I didn't really know what I was doing, but when I recieved unanimously positive feedback from my initial playtesters
                I knew that I'd stumbled upon something incredible.
			</p><p class=text>
                Since then, the game has become much more than just a student project.
                Cheating Death is still very much in active development.
                I'm always looking for tiny changes that I can make to improve the experience.
                I routinely bring it to local gaming groups to playtest and get any feedback that I can.
